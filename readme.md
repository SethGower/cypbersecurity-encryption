# Seth's Encryption Course

Since the provided course material isn't great for a lot of the course, I have
written some of my own stuff. Most of my functions are located in the
`ciphers.py` file, which can just be imported as a library, as I do in
`main.py`. I will be adding more, and if you have other things or questions,
please feel free to make issues or even pull requests.
